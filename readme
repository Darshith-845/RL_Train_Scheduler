Okay so I have started working on three apporadches greedy , milp and rl agent based

I am more interested in seeing whether the rl based model works not 
For now the emphasis is given on the conflict resolution , scheduling proiority , and using platforms efficiently

Mean Reward: 41.94 Conflicts per Episode: 0.22 High Priority Success Rate: 97.0 % Avg Waiting Time: 1.84 Platform Utilization Balance: 0.255

This was the initial results. Here it can be seen that platform utilization is pretty less thats why lets penalize the model when it doesn't spread accross all the platforms and reward it upon using all platforms efficiently
Initially timestep was 50000, now i have made it 500000, which is around 245 iterations.

Now this is what I am getting 
Evaluation Results over 50 episodes Mean Reward: 49.0 Conflicts per Episode: 0.0 High Priority Success Rate: 100.0 % Avg Waiting Time: 0.0 Platform Utilization Balance: 0.25
Yuss yuss and this is clearly overfitting with 0 conflicts and 100 percent high priority success, not to mention the platform utilization is 0,25 that is it is using 1 out of 4 platforms regularly that is it is exploiting one platform for maximum returns 


Inorder to check whether it has overfitted or not , I created that file that will create random 50 timetable s and tested it and as I expected, this is what I get

Its definated overfitting 

Okay I think the main reason of this overfitting is that it has trained on a single timetable and got used to it so lets generalize it for 50 timetables first
Lets create a new file to generalize this 

Evaluation Results over 50 episodes
Mean Reward: 40.8
Conflicts per Episode: 0.0
High Priority Success Rate: 100.0 %
Avg Waiting Time: 0.0

Its again overfitting
